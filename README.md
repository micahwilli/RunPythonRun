# RunPythonRun

My first attempt using GitHub for a place to put something I wrote rather than just downloading other people's work. 

This a simple Python script to sit in a folder and run other Python Scripts. If a certian script breaks, a log file is written telling which script broke and the process exits. If all the scripts run, the text file reflects that result.
